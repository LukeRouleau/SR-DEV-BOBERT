# SR-DEV-BOBERT ROS Melodic Implementation
Create a ROS-running autonomous robot powered by the Nvidia Jetson. Since the Jetson runs Ubuntu 18, ROS Melodic runs natively! Yay!


## State of Affairs

### Steps Taken [as of Alpha Build 1/21/22]:
- Install ROS Melodic onto the Nvidia Jetson 
  - Based entirely off of [Nvidia's example](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetbot_ros/tree/melodic) 
- Install Gazebo for ROS Melodic
- Install the RealSense Library & Wrappers for ROS Melodic
